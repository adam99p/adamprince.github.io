<p class="p1">BREAKING NEWS UGA RANKS #1<br> 
The first College Football Playoff Rankings have been released and Georgia finds itself in uncharted territory. The Bulldogs come in at No. 1, their highest ever ranking in the poll since it started in 2014.

Alabama opened as the No. 2 team in the nation per the rankings. Notre Dame came in at No. 3 and Clemson at No. 4.  Oklahoma came in at No. 5 and Ohio State at No. 6.

Georgiaâ€™s previous high-water mark had been No. 9. It held that spot in 2014 after a win over No. 9 Auburn. The Bulldogs jumped from 15th to ninth but would later tumble a bit when it lost at home to Georgia Tech.

The Bulldogs are highly-thought-of by the committee for a number of reasons. They have wins over two ranked teams in Notre Dame  and Mississippi State (No. 16). The AP and coaches polls already have the Bulldogs at No. 2.

<p class="p2">YOUR GEORGIA FOOTBALL TAILGATING GUIDE, PLUS THE BEST BARS AND RESTAURANTS TO HIT<br>
When one compiles a list of the best college towns in America, mention of Athens, Ga., is pretty much required. Home to the University of Georgia and roughly 115,000 residents, it's not too big, not too small. The Classic City features great bars and restaurants -- probably as good as any college town in the country -- and an incredible music scene that has produced the likes of R.E.M., Neutral Milk Hotel, Of Montreal and the Drive-By Truckers, just to name a few.The university does have some rules about tailgating," said MaconDawg, "the most important of which for visiting Cajuns are no booze on the sidewalks or in the streets, no setting up your tailgate before 7 a.m., and parking is awful around campus on game day weekends, and if you park on the sidewalk, your car may be gone when you get back to it.Be prepared to either arrive very early in the morning or park pretty far away. Parking near the stadium is almost exclusively by pass only. My favorite spot -- which I can't believe I'm divulging -- is along Milledge Avenue, which leads south out of Athens toward the Macon Highway. Several businesses and churches there will let you park for a reasonable fee ($10-15), it's less than two miles from the stadium, and you'll pass through a lot of good tailgating on the way, including my personal favorite spot on the lawn of the Georgia Center for Continuing Education.

<p class="p3">GEORGIA BULLDOGS VS. AUBURN TIGERS ODDS, COLLEGE FOOTBALL BETTING PICK<br>
The Georgia Bulldogs hold the upper paw in the recent series with the Auburn Tigers, winning nine of the last 11 meetings straight up and going 8-3 against the spread. In the 121st edition of the Deep South's Oldest Rivalry, the Bulldogs tangle with the Tigers on Saturday afternoon at Jordan-Hare Stadium.<br>
WHY THE GEORGIA BULLDOGS CAN COVER THE SPREAD<br>
The Bulldogs are now 9-0 on the season following their 24-10 victory over South Carolina last week. Georgia started slowly and only led the Gamecocks 14-7 at the half. But the Bulldogs scored the first touchdown out of the locker room and held on from there.

On the day, Georgia outgained South Carolina 438-270, outrushed the Gamecocks 242-43 and held a 38-22 time of possession advantage. The Bulldogs have now outgained and outrushed each of their nine opponents this season.

Georgia's victory, combined with a Kentucky loss, clinched a spot in the SEC Championship Game for the Bulldogs. But they've still got bigger things in mind, like a berth in the College Football Playoff. However, with a probable matchup against Alabama in the conference championship game coming up, Georgia might not be able to afford even one slip before that.
